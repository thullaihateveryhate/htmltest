**Stockd turns inventory data into restaurant profits.** We help restaurants improve margins by 2-5%, save 8+ hours per week, and increase revenue 10-15% during peak periods through intelligent inventory management and dynamic pricing.

## 🚀 The Problem

Every year, restaurants in the United States waste **22-33 billion pounds of food** and lose **$162 billion annually** to food waste. The average restaurant throws away **4-10% of purchases** before it reaches a customer's plate.

**Why?** Most restaurants still track inventory with pen and paper or basic spreadsheets, leading to:
- Guesswork ordering based on gut feeling
- Over-purchasing that results in spoilage
- Stockouts and lost revenue
- No visibility into usage patterns

Traditional inventory systems cost thousands per month or are too complex for daily use.

### Core Algorithms

**Days of Supply:**
```
Days of Supply = Quantity on Hand / Average Daily Usage
```

**Forecast Error (MAPE):**
```
MAPE = (100% / n) × Σ|Actual - Forecast| / Actual
```
